# Image to shulkers

This repository contains the files you need to get you started turning any image you want into a wall of shulkers in minecraft. As of now the process of getting the commands to spawn the shulkers is not automated, that means when the program is done it will output a text file will all the commands you need to execute in your minecraft world.

Also, the RGB values are *semi* hardcoded, what I mean by that is that the program needs a **config file** to understand what RGB values correspond to what colour although I prefer it this way because I can customize it as much as I want and bacause every colour can have multiple RGB values.

### TODO

1) Automate the process of spawning shulkers after the script is finished working, maybe even some performance improvements if that is deemed necessary.

2) Maybe cleanup the code because I am not that experienced with C# and my code may be quite crappy.
